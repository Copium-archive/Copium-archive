Ever since my first drop of consciousness, I've realized that human existence remains obsolete in the universe's grand scheme — we're nothing but clouds of atoms floating through the endless cosmos.  

Money, sex, power…? The things hardwired to our survival, driving us into a perpetual zero-sum game — But do any of them hold meaning once we’ve left God’s green earth?  
**Prolly none.**

But as the saying goes: *"A man may die, but not his ideas."*  
So, welcome to **Copium-archive** — my digital footprint, my legacy to the world, and my retaliation against the hive mind.
